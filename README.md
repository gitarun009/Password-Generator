# 🔐 Password Generator

**Password Generator** is a minimal, responsive web application that helps users create secure, random passwords with ease. It includes customizable options like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and even displays a real-time password strength meter. The design is clean, modern, and fully mobile-friendly.

This beginner-to-intermediate project is a great demonstration of DOM manipulation, user input handling, and dynamic UI feedback — all built without frameworks.
